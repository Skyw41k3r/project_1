# anime_info_search

## Description

The goal of this project was to provide a quick search function that provides quick, succinct information on anime films and series. Upon searching an anime title, the user will be provided with a trailer video to watch as well as a brief description and score for that title. This was accomplished using the YouTube APi as well as the Jikan Unofficial MAL API.

## Installation

This project may be used live at https://skyw41k3r.github.io/project_1/ in an HTML5 compatible web browser.

## Usage

Type in the name of an anime in the search bar and press enter. The website will return a YouTube trailer as well as a subset of the most relevant titles related to it on the sidebar. Furthermore, clicking on the cards in the sidebar will show a brief summary and user score for that title.
